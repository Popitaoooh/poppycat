<h2>Discipline</h2>
<p><b>Do not strike your cat, do not spray your cat.</b> These are harmful punishments that may make your cat scared, aggressive, or uncomfortable. Instead, if your cat, like mine, doesn’t like to be picked up, <b>DON’T</b> pick them up. Instead, act like you’re going to pick them up by putting one hand on their tummy and with any luck they’ll stop. If your cat doesn’t mind being picked up or will not let you touch their tummy, you could try to lure them into doing something good, like instead of scratching on the couch, buy some more scratching posts and teach them that those are their’s, not the couch. If they are going potty in the house, show them where all of the litter is, and, if need be, buy some more litter boxes. If all else fails, just try to ignore the bad behavior if it’s attention seeking behavior. Once they do the good behavior, reward them with a treat and a click from the clicker. Typically they will eventually stop within a few months of reinforcement.

<div class="section">
<h2>Clicker Training</h2>
<p>Clicker Training is one of the most important parts of training cats. If you don’t teach your cat what the clicker means or represents, they will have a harder time learning. Some people think that the clicker makes the cat do the action, but no. It only reinforces good behavior. It’s less like a remote and more like a camera. This is the key. Everytime your cat does a specific wanted behavior, reward your cat with a click. Then, follow it up with a treat. Every now and then you can stall the treat a little bit by waiting a few seconds before rewarding them with the treat. This teaches them to wait a little before they get antsy.</p>

<div id="lookatme"></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Look at Me</h2>
<p>One of the most basic commands you can teach your cat. You can use this to get your cat’s attention for photos and such.</p>
<h3><b>How to:</b></h3>
<p>Hold a treat between your middle finger and thumb. Say whatever you choose the command to be, in this case, “Look at Me”. If your cat looks at you, click the clicker and give them the treat. If they don’t look at you in a timely manner, point your index finger to their nose using the hand with the treat in it and drag your index finger up to your face, pointing at it. Repeat this until they fully comprehend the trick.
</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div id="theirname"></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Their Name</h2>
<p>This is an important trick that your cat will likely learn over time. If they are struggling to learn their name, you can speed this up by following along this guide.</p>
<h3><b>How to:</b></h3>
<p>Get your cat’s attention. Then, say their name and give them a treat. After a little bit, substitute the treat for a click from the clicker. Remember to still give them a treat after you click, but only if they give you their attention. Repeat this until they fully understand and respond to their name unconditionally.
</p>
</div>

<div id="come"></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Come</h2>
<p>An important step in harness training and just in general is teaching your feline to come on command. It’s pretty quick and simple once you get the gist of it.</p>
<h3><b>How to:</b></h3>
<p>Get your cat’s attention. Hold a treat out in front of their nose and say, “Come.” When they approach you, click the clicker and give them the treat. Repeat this until they fully understand and can repeat whenever asked to.
</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div id="sit"></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Sit</h2>
<p>Another simple command that anyone can teach is to get your cat to sit down when alerted to. This is one of the easiest tricks for cats to learn.</p>
<h3><b>How to:</b></h3>
<p>Get your cat’s attention. Then hold a treat right in front of their nose but angled a little towards you. When they sit, click the clicker and give them the treat. Repeat this until they fully understand and sit unconditionally.
</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div id="over"></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Over</h2>
<p>If you want your cat to go somewhere where you are not, the “over” command is a very useful tool. It’s a very simple trick that any cat can learn.</p>
<h3><b>How to:</b></h3>
<p>Get your cat’s attention. Point down at the ground in the direction you want them to go with a treat held between your middle finger and thumb. If they do not go over immediately, pull your index finger in and push it out repeatedly until they do. Repeat this until they fully understand and can repeat whenever asked to.
</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div id="territory"></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Bed/Territory</h2>
<p>If your cat is getting in the way of something and you want them to leave you alone, you can teach them how to. This is a little harder for them to learn, and depending on the cat, it may take a while for them to have it down.</p>
<h3><b>How to:</b></h3>
<p>Have a bed or mat or just place that your cat enjoys to hang out on. Make sure that they feel comfortable while laying down on it. Stand next to the bed or mat and throw a treat onto it. Say, “Bed” or something of the sort. Once they go to the bed, reward them with a click and, if they stay there, another treat.
</p>

<div id="highfive"></div>
<h2>High Five</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>This trick is for those who want to show off how intelligent they and their cat are. It’s also pretty simple, anyone can learn it.</p>
<h3><b>How to:</b></h3>
<p>Hold a treat between your palm and thumb. Then move your hand to eye level with your cat. If they paw at it, give them the treat and a click. Alternatively, teach them how to stand on their hind legs and grab your hand if they don’t paw at it the normal way. Then you can start moving your hand down to eye level of your cat.
