<h2>What is Poppy's Cat Training?<h2>
<div class="section">
<p>You may have thought that teaching your cat to behave is next to impossible. That is far from the truth. At Poppy's Cat Training, I have been training cats for years and I've come to the realization that cats, with their
more lax personalities, are typically easier to train than dogs. There are some exceptions, sure. But when it really comes down to it, cats are less rowdy and way more calm. I've trained cats since the moment that I had
one, and it's my mission to help teach the world about the wonders of training cats with my cheap classes.</p>

<h2>Scheduling<h2>
<div class="section">
<p>It's vital to set up a schedule with your cats. Whether you do it on the weekends, weekdays, Mondays or Fridays, it's important that you have a dedicated training time at least twice a week as to allow them to remember tricks better. 
You don't need to train them everyday. But be sure to sprinkle some commands throughout your daily activities so that they can better remember and react to the commands accordingly, even without a reward <i>in site</i>. Still,
give them a reward, but not too much.</p>
